            <div id="description">
                <p>The idea I came up with was to combine an automatic rubbish bin with a plastic bag sealer. </p> 
                <p>I thought it could be somewhat useful if I could managed to make it work.</p>
            </div>

            </div>

            <div id="description">
                <p>The basic way I envisioned it was a rubbish bin that has a plastic sealer that can be mounted onto it, with an ultrasonic sensor to tirgger</p>
                <p>the lid opening mechanism. In initial concept sketches, I planned to to create a half-cylindrical body out of laser cut plywood, using a living. </p> 
                <p>hinge. But after some consideration i figured that such a design would make the walls very fragile, and would require some internal supporting</p>
                <p>structures to hold its shape. I also had to reconsider the original linkage mechanism for the lid as it was unneccessarily complicated</p>
            </div>

            <div id="description">
                <p>In the end, I decided to go with a cuboid shape, with only the front corners featuring living hinges for a more aesthetically pleasing shape.</p>
                <p>For the lid mechanism, I just kept it simple and decided to try using a servo motor to open the lid directly.</p>

                <h3>2. 3D-Modelling</h3>
            </div>

            <div id="description">
                <p>After the design considerations, I began 3D modelling the main body in Fusion 360. First I created the front wall with the living hinge, as well as</p>
                <p>cutouts for the plastic sealer and wiring. Then I created the backwall and some internal platforms for the servo motor and ciruit cover.</p>

            </div>

            <div id="description">
                <p>I then created the external features such as the hinge for the lid and the cover for the ultrasonic sensor.</p>

            <div id="description">
                <p>For the plastic sealer, I had to refer to online recources to see how I could replicate the mechanism.</p>

            <div id="description">
                <p>I then recreated the mechanism in Fusion but scaled everything down so that it could fit into a smaller housing and work with a smaller roll of tape.</p>

            </div>

            <div id="description">
                <p>I wired up, and programmed the circuit in TinkerCAD. The circuit consists of an ultrasonic sensor and a servo motor wired to a breadboard,</p>
                <p>with an Arduino UNO as a microcontroller.</p>

                <p>Once the parts have all been fabricated, I started building the project. The main body was mainly put together by finger joints, with some glue to reinforce</p>
                <p>parts that don't fit well due wood warping. I also used nuts and bolts to fasten the hinge to the lid and back wall. For the rest of the loose componets,</p>
                <p>I used hot glue to fix them to the body.</p>

            </div>

            <div id="description">
                <p>There were multiple problems that came up during the design process that needed to be solved either through redesigning or modifying some parts</p>
                <p>using crude DIY methods.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="description">
                <p>1. The initial design for the hinge was too thin, leading to the shaft of the hinge to be fragile and break during assembly. To fix this, I</p>
                <p>redesigned the hinge so that its thicker at the section with the mechanism to make it stronger.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="img2">

            </div>

            <div id="description">
                <p>2. The slits in the living hinge were too long, causing it to fray at the edges and lack structure.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="img2">
                <img src="images/FinalChallenges2.jpg" height="500" alt="Picture of laser cut living hinge">
            </div>

            <div id="description">
                <p>To fix this i redesigned the living hinge to have double the number of slits along</p>
                <p>the height of the wall, and made each slit shorter.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="description">
                <p>3. The ultrasonic sensor was giving a lot of false positives and would trigger the servo motor even when there no object</p>
                <p>in range. To fix this, i changed the code so that intead of using the sensor's readings to activate the motor directly,</p>
                <p>the readings are averaged out and compared against a threshold value. The motor is only activated when the average</p>
                <p>readings is falls below the threshold, which allow the circuit to be more consistent with less false positives.</p>

            <div id="description">
                <p>4. Another issue was that the sound of the lid closing was very loud and disturbing. To fix this, I hot glued some styrofoam</p>
                <p>padding around the rim of the bin to cushion the lid when it closes and reduce the noise.</p>
